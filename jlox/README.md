# JLox

A Lox interpreter implementation using Java that follows [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com).

As this is a rather long book, I didn't know if I was ready to commit and finish it until chapter 12, which is when I added git.

To run Lox, open this project and run the [`jlox/Lox.main`](./src/jlox/Lox.java) on whatever file you see fit. The file [`example.lox`](./src/example/example.lox) is there for my own personal convenience to easily run Lox with an automated task, feel free to use it as you see fit.
